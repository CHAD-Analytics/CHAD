dashboard for their AF installation.*

    drop-down box. Options include all United States active duty, air
    national guard, and air force reserve installations.

2.  **Local Radius**: How large of an area around the installation is
    considered. Ranges from 10 - 100 miles with a default of 50 miles.
    Data from all counties within that range will be considered in the
    calculations, idependent of the specific state that the installation
    resides.

    local area map on the Current Local Health Tab is protrayed.

    local radius selected. The local area data being displayed
    throughout the dashboard only incorporates these counties. These
    counties are portrayed in the bottom right table of this tab.
    **NOTE:** The radius is centered on the base of interest and includes
    counties whose centroid falls within the radius. County locations that have 
    non-symmetrical boundaries may or may not be included in te local health 
    calculations. You can select/deselect counties on the local health tab
    to include or exclude counties in the calculations.

-   Selecting *State* portrays all counties from any state that resides
    within the local radius selected.  
    **NOTE:** This option is available to better orient the user to the
    geographic location of the local area counties within their
    respective states. All counties portrayed when this option is
    selected are **NOT** necessarily included in the local area data.

    daily hospitalizations or cumulative deaths

    displays predictive model projections.
