### About CHAD

The Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) COVID-19 Health Assessment Dashboard (CHAD)
was designed and developed by March 2020 graduates of the Department of Operational Sciences.
The CHAD Dashboard is being used amongst many tools to help the Department of the Air Force make
more informed decisions. No one tool should be used out of context to understand the scope of the
COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to note many variables and assumptions have been made to develop
this tool to help understand a few of the many planning considerations as the Department of the 
Air Force seeks to support our Nation, Airmen, and Families.

### What is CHAD?

CHAD was designed to give leaders across the Department of the Air Force
an accessible, centralized location to receive customizable, up-to-date 
COVID-19 information for active duty, national guard, and reserve Air Force Installations. This application is
the result of rapid response efforts to address the escalating fight
against COVID-19. Up-to-date pandemic information automatically updates
daily through various open source datasets listed in the *Sources* info
panel and model projections described in the *Projections* info panel.

### How Can I Use CHAD?

The user can **move across the top tab bar** to receive different
information regarding the national COVID-19 status, the local COVID-19
status, and local situational projections moving forward. All
information displayed updates live with changes in user input facotrs 
defined on the left sidebar.

Users can **adjust various input factors** in the left
sidebar to customize the dashboard experience. Select the Air
Force installation that pertains to you and CHAD will automatically
update with data relating to your installation. Additional inputs can be
defined to customize user experience. However, all additional inputs
have default values. More information about those default values and
the scaling/aggregation approach we use can be found on the *Calculations*
info panel (for the National Summary and Current Local Health tabs) and
the *Projections* info panel (for the Projections tabs)

When using the model projections, it is important to keep in mind that these are based on models with multiple parameters and **subject to considerable uncertainty**.  Additionally, reasonable parameter values will vary locally and over time subject to changes in mitigation behavior (e.g. social distancing) and other factors.  Read more in the *Projections* info panel and reach out to the designated A9 representative for your MAJCOM for additional support and assistance.

**Download a comprehensive report** of the information diplayed on the
dashboard by clicking the *Generate Report* button at the bottom of the
left sidebar.

### Supporting Agencies
Various agencies were involved to launch CHAD. The design and development of CHAD was sponsored by the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), who was critical in ensuring appropriate contacts and collaborations were successful. Additional collaboration was conducted with Army Futures Command in developing model projections.

### Other Agency Resources
Air Mobility Command (AMC) has also developed a tool to provide insights on the spread of COVID-19. The SEIR model developed by AMC/A9 presents the expected epidemiology impact to local personnel based on parameters derived from available data. This model allows users to compare COAs and preventative policies to view corresponding effects on air and support crews. This can be adapted to organizations outside of flying wings with the aid of MAJCOM analysts.
