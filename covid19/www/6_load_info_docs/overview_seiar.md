### MODEL CONTROLS

The MODEL CONTROLS page includes inputs (i.e., dropdown, write-in, or slider) which can be adjusted to reflect local conditions. Default values are set to the most recent data published by authoritative sources. 

First, select the Army MTF you would like to model. Where necessary, adjust the model controls. Click the RUN MODEL button at the bottom of the page to produce tables and figures from the estimates. 

### FACILITY IMPACT

The FACILITY IMPACT page auto-populates the size of enrollees at risk and the number of available beds. Tables and figures can be downloaded.

### Census Analysis Tab

The census analysis shows the growth in impact at the selected MTF. Impact is represented by three types of information that are displayed: number of hospitalized (red line), number of ICU admissions (green line), and number of ventilators used (blue line).The black horizontal line depicts the current capacity at the MTF. The section above the black line illustrates the timing and number of days (from the model run date) that MTF resources may be overwhelmed. It also identifies the maximum number of beds that will ultimately be required under the current estimates.

Seven indicators are provided at the top of the figure:

1.	Rt: number of individuals that may be exposed to COVID-19 by an infected person.
2.	Doubling time: period of days where number of cases doubled.
3.	Beds available: number of beds available at a given MTF. 
4.	Max required beds: estimated maximum number of hospital beds required to treat patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the peak of the infection cycle.  
5.	Max ICU admissions: estimated maximum number of ICU admissions at the peak of the infection cycle.
6.	Max ventilated: estimated maximum number of ventilators required at the peak of the infection cycle. 
7.	Time of max: number of days from the model run date to reach the peak of the infection cycle. 

### Admissions Analysis Tab

The admissions analysis estimates resourcing needs by predicting how many new patients may require hospitalization, ICU admission, or ventilator support on a daily basis.  
Seven indicators are provided at the top of the figure: 

1.	Rt: number of individuals that may be exposed to COVID-19 by an infected person.
2.	Doubling time: period of days where number of cases to doubled.
3.	Beds available: number of beds available at a given MTF.
4.	Max daily additional beds: estimated maximum number of additional beds which is needed to treat hospitalized patients. 
5.	Max daily additional ICU patients: estimated maximum number of additional patients which requires ICU support. 
6.	Max daily additional ventilated: estimated maximum number of additional ventilators required.
7.	Time of max: number of days from the model run date before hospital resources are exhausted. 
 
### Data Tab 

The data tab displays a table providing a cumulative day-by-day estimate, where:  

1.	S refers to the number of susceptible people,
2.  E refers to the number of exposed people,
3.	I refers to the number of infectious people,
4.  A refers to the number of asymptomatic people, and
5.	R refers to the number of recovered people.

In addition, six estimates are provided:

1.	Hospital admit: number of patients admitted to the hospital on a single day.
2.	Hospital total: cumulative number of patients admitted to the hospital.
3.	ICU admit: number of patients requiring ICU support on a single day. 
4.	ICU total: cumulative number of patients requiring ICU support.
5.	Vent admit: number of ventilators required on a single day. 
6.	Vent total: cumulative number of ventilators required.

MTF REPORTS

The MTF REPORTS page allows users to download the report for the selected MTF.
