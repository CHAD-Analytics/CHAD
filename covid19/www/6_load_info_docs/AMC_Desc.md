## AMC Infection Model

AMC's infection model is updated at least twice per week. Community definitions differ by base.  Active Duty AMC base communities are assumed to extend **45 minutes driving time** from the base in all directions.  Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve AMC base communities are assumed to be within a **90-minute drive time** radius.  All other bases assume a **50 mile radius**.

All projections assume that the effectiveness social distancing measures follow the same general trend as observed in Italy and Spain, and that such measures will remain in place indefinately.  As such, this model __only projects impacts from the first "wave" of COVID-19 infections__.

Infection projections may appear higher than current confirmed cases.
This is because the model projections include all infections; **symptomatic and asymptomatic**, as well as those individuals simply told to self-isolate without having been tested.  In general, this model projects infections **10-20 times higher** than reported infections.   

All numbers presented here represent estimates from model projections, including all values be
