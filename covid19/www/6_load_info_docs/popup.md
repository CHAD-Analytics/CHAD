CHAD is entering a maintenance only stage. CHAD's most used features and functionality have been transitioned into **AFRL's EXAIL dashboard**. That dashboard can be accessed via the links below for the public or FOUO version.

### Can I continue using CHAD?

Yes, though we recommend using AFRL's EXAIL product since it has majority of the features users loved from CHAD, and it is being actively maintained and supported. 

Until the pandemic subsides, CHAD will continue to run. Albeit with less featues to improve speed and give a streamlined experience to the necessary information. The team apologizes for any increase in application downtime as we work with this new state of operations.


### What was the motivation for the move?

CHAD was developed by a group of volunteer analysts looking to make a low to no-cost product to Air Force senior leaders to make informed decisions within their local area regarding the impact of COVID-19. To that end the team exceeded expectations and developed an application that influenced the current market of COVID-19 dashboards and took off across the DoD. It was never meant to be the final solution, but always designed to be a stop-gap and minimally viable product until a larger organization could develop and sustain a more complete product. AFRL has accomplished this with their EXAIL product, and has an excellent team to support and maintain it. 

The CHAD team thanks everyone who helped and contributed to this project. It was truly a community project that would not have taken off nor provided as much as impact as it did if it wasn't for the support and assistance the community gave to raise this up. It's inspiring to see what the analytic community can do if you give them an idea, a platform, and the freedom to colloborate and express their creativity.

With that the team has gone back to their primary duties, and will continue to keep CHAD running as long as this pandemic continues on.
