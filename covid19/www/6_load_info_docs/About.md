### About CHAD

The Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) COVID-19 Health Assessment Dashboard (CHAD)
was designed and developed by March 2020 graduates of the Department of Operational Sciences.
The CHAD Dashboard is being used amongst many tools to help the Department of the Air Force make
more informed decisions. No one tool should be used out of context to understand the scope of the
COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to note many variables and assumptions have been made to develop
this tool to help understand a few of the many planning considerations as the Department of the 
Air Force seeks to support our Nation, Airmen, and Families.
