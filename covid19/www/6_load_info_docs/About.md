## About CHAD

#### Brief History

The Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) and HAF/A9 COVID-19 Health Assessment Dashboard (CHAD)
was initially designed and developed by March 2020 graduates of the Department of Operational Sciences. These graduates (Capt James Deitschel, 1st Lt Garrett Alarcon, 2d Lt Nicholas Forrest, 2d Lt Trey Pujats) conceived this project as a way to provide leaders up-to-date pandemic information specifically tailored to military installations and surrounding counties. This included hospital capacity in an area, new cases, case growth, forecasting of cases, and local and national summaries. Information that while available, existed in too many disparate sources. Bringing this together into a single cohesive experience enabled leaders across the Department of the Air Force to make rapid and informed decisions regarding the pandemic in their area since the start of April.    

#### Current

CHAD development and usage has been adopted by HAF/A9, and is still being supported by AFIT. Majority of MAJCOMs, along with Air Staff have been using CHAD daily to provide critical up-to-date information to senior leaders. Recent updates have allowed the inclusion of Army, Navy, and Marine installations making it a Joint force tool.

The current team at HAF/A9 maintaining and developing CHAD consists of: 
* Maj Taylor Leonard
* Capt Andrew Keith
* 1st Lt Garrett Alarcon
