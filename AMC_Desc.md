## AMC Infection Model

AMC's infection model is updated every week. All projections are done from a **50 mile radius** around bases, 
with the exception being AMC bases which are computed at a 30 mile radius.

All numbers presented here represent estimates from model projections. 
Including all values before the current day line and after.

Infection projections may appear higher than current confirmed cases.
This is because the model projections include all infections; **symptomatic and asymptomatic**.
