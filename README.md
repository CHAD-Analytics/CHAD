# CHAD
The **current** app is hosted on shiny web servers and can be used by following the link here: https://covid19dash.shinyapps.io/covid19/.

There is also a **test server** which host new features to the application that are undergoing testing at: https://covid19dash.shinyapps.io/CHAD-Test/

## Getting Started
The most up to date app is located in the covid19 folder. This folder contains a global.R, server.R, and ui.R file. 
These files contain the most up to date CHAD application. Ensure you have all packages installed and loaded.
We have been using the most up to date version of R for the application. Note we are still updating it daily, so there may be issues.
